# DiscordPokedex


This is a WIP Discord bot that requires discord.js

This Pokedex is designed with statistics for the Pokemon Go mobile app.
This bot is designed to accept input from users within Discord and reply with important information on Pokemon type as well as specific Pokemon.

You can use the utility to enter all the needed information in an easier to read format. It will then compile the data into the required format within the large text box. Copy/paste the new information into the proper section of NewPokedex.js. After updates have been made, please feel free to create a PR for merging.

A better write up/wiki will be coming soon but please feel free to create a PR if you want to make any updates/additions.

Contact me on Discord if you have any questions, Gladiator10864#0384
